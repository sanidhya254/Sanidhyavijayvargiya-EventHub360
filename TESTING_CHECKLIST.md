## 📊 Database Integrity Tests

```sql
-- Check all users
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Check passwords are hashed
SELECT email, 
       CASE 
         WHEN password LIKE '$2b$%' THEN 'Hashed'
         ELSE 'NOT HASHED'
       END as password_status
FROM users;

-- Check password reset tokens
SELECT * FROM password_reset WHERE expires_at > NOW();

-- Check verified users
SELECT email, verified FROM users;

-- Check admin users
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Check last login
SELECT email, last_login FROM users ORDER BY last_login DESC;
```

## 🚀 Performance Tests

- [ ] Signup completes in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Login completes in < 1 second
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 1 second
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Password reset completes in < 2 seconds

## 🔐 Security Tests

- [ ] Passwords are hashed (not visible in DB)
- [ ] Tokens are not stored in plain text (localStorage is client-side)
- [ ] CORS works (frontend can call backend)
- [ ] Protected routes require token
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected
- [ ] Admin routes require admin role
- [ ] SQL injection attempt fails gracefully
- [ ] CSRF tokens present (if applicable)
